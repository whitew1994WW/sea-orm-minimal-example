# Minimal Sea-ORM Test

Planning on using Sea-ORM for Rust in another project and wanted to test how it works.

This repo contains a minimal example. The `entity/src/cake` file stores the ORM object `cake` which contains only two fields.

The `migration/src/m20220....rs` file was originally generated by the sea-orm cli tool. I have just changed the `up` and `down` functions to create and destroy the `cakes` table.

The entry for the script is the `src/main` file. The creates the table, inserts a row, changes the row and then reads the row.

It uses a postgres database setup with the included dockerfile. To check that the `cake` entity has loaded into the database, after running the container I connected using:

`docker exec -ti my-postgresdb-container psql -U postgres -d world`.
